# Problem Context and Rationale

BayarR began with a practical insight: most payment coordination still happens inside chat. The best experience is a simple link, a clear confirmation, and no back-and-forth. Anything more adds friction for a small request.

Indonesia is mobile-first with a strong builder community. The Base Indonesia Hackathon is the right environment to validate a focused, onchain payment flow that feels everyday rather than experimental.

## The Problem

Small payments are still operationally heavy:
- The creator sends bank details or a wallet address.
- The buyer transfers and sends proof.
- The creator verifies and confirms.
- Both sides lose time and context.

Web3 can eliminate manual confirmation, but many dApps are optimized for advanced users. The experience often includes unnecessary steps (swaps, analytics, wallet configuration) that do not belong in a simple payment request.

## The Opportunity

- Base provides fast, low-cost confirmations for small transfers.
- IDRX aligns with local currency expectations and reduces volatility concerns.
- A mini-app can match the existing chat behavior: create -> share -> pay.

## The Product Thesis

BayarR is intentionally scoped:
- No inbox.
- No marketplace.
- No extra pages beyond the paylink flow.

It is a coordination tool, not a platform. The less the user has to learn, the more likely they are to adopt it in real conversations.

## Why Now

Hackathons reward speed and clarity. BayarR focuses on the single most valuable behavior:
- Create an onchain request.
- Pay in one action.
- Confirm instantly.

That is enough to validate demand and open the door to partnerships, pilots, and broader adoption.
