# Roadmap

BayarR is intentionally small for hackathon speed. The next phase focuses on stability and sharing.

## Short Term

- PWA manifest + installable experience
- Receipt export or share
- Optional paylink list for creators

## Medium Term

- Optional paid analytics (conversion and status)
- Vanity links and custom branding
- Multi-currency support (IDRX + additional stable assets)

## Long Term

- Ecosystem integrations (chat bots, commerce tools)
- Onchain identity and trust layers
- Partner onboarding flows for merchants
